# Prerequisites
1. gcloud auth login (To authenticate with GCP)
2. gcloud config set project <PROJECT_ID> (Set project id)


1. List All Persistent Disks
First, get a list of all SSD disks in your project and their corresponding VM instances:

gcloud compute disks list --filter="type:(pd-standard)" --format="value(sizeGb, name, zone)"

2. List All VM Instances
Get a list of all VM instances and their associated disks:

gcloud compute instances list --format="table(name, disks[].deviceName)"

3. Calculate the Disk Cost
According to GCP pricing calculator for region asia-south1 for zonal pd ssd, price is approx 17 RS/GB per month

to minimise the effort

#!/bin/bash

# Set the cost per GB for SSD disks
SSD_COST_PER_GB=17

# Initialize a variable to store the total cost
total_cost=0

# Get the list of SSD persistent disks with their size in GB
echo "Fetching SSD disk information..."
gcloud compute disks list --filter="type:(pd-standard)" --format="value(sizeGb)" > disks.txt

# Read each disk size and calculate the total cost
while read -r disk_size; do
    # Calculate the cost for each disk and add it to the total cost
    disk_cost=$(echo "$disk_size * $SSD_COST_PER_GB" | bc)
    total_cost=$(echo "$total_cost + $disk_cost" | bc)
done < disks.txt

# Output the total cost of all SSD persistent disks
echo "Total Estimated Monthly Cost of SSD Disks: \$$total_cost"

# Cleanup
rm disks.txt
